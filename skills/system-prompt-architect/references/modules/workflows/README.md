# Workflow Modules

This directory contains reusable workflow patterns for agent processes.

## Purpose

Workflows define structured processes for:
- Sequential task execution
- Decision-making procedures
- Iterative refinement loops
- Error handling and recovery

## Available Templates

### sequential-pipeline.md
Linear multi-stage process with clear handoffs between stages.

### iterative-refinement.md
Feedback loop for progressive quality improvement.

### research-workflow.md
Structured information gathering and synthesis process.

### decision-tree.md
Branching logic for handling different scenarios.

### parallel-execution.md
Concurrent task processing with synchronization.

## Usage

Each template provides:
1. **Process Diagram**: Visual flow representation
2. **Stage Definitions**: Clear step-by-step procedures
3. **Transition Conditions**: When to move between stages
4. **Error Handling**: Recovery strategies for failures
